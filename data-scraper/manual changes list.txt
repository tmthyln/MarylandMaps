manual changes:

added lat long for locations based on their location tags. (maps might show different lat-long)
filled missing location tags for some maps
G3709 .32.C6P5 1780 .D47 map was duplicate, removed it from the database

should we add categories for map types ourselves? or label them as uncategorized?
having a clean year attribute with approximate dates~?
